# Introduction
The brief specified that the task was to design and create a crud application with a visual front-end that encapsulated all core modules. 
For my project I decided to create an inventory that stores information on cakes, where uses can add their own cakes to the database while also making other necessary changes. The API comes with a fully CRUD functional front-end webpage in which uses can interact and provide inputs.

# Scope
Project Management - Jira
Databases - SQL
Java SE/Springboot
Testing - Mock MVC
Front-End - API Integration

# Planning
I used Jira software to create my Kanban board, I selected the scrum model. Here I began with creating user stories and tasks, assigning them to appropriate epics. I also made sure to implement agile principles and moscow prioritisation while also providing story point estimates. AFter filling up the backlog, I started a sprint to help me track tasks. The sprint board was used to manage tasks moving them fron to do to in progress to done.

One of the first tasks set on my user stories were to design a template for my web page. I used draw.io and Invisionfreehand to sketch an initial template and then a prototype webpage.
