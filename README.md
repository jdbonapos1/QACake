# Eri's Cakeclopedia 
by JD Bonapos

# Introduction
The brief specified that the task was to design and create a crud application with a visual front-end that encapsulated all core modules. 
For my project I decided to create an inventory that stores information on cakes, where uses can add their own cakes to the database while also making other necessary changes. The API comes with a fully CRUD functional front-end webpage in which uses can interact and provide inputs.

# Scope
Project Management - Jira
Databases - SQL
Java SE/Springboot
Testing - Mock MVC
Front-End - API Integration

# Planning
I used Jira software to create my Kanban board, I selected the scrum model. Here I began with creating user stories and tasks, assigning them to appropriate epics. I also made sure to implement agile principles and moscow prioritisation while also providing story point estimates.
